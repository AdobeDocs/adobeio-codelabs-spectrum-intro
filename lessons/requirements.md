## Requirements

Spectrum, Spectrum CSS and React Spectrum are open source projects meaning you don't need to be granted access since it's all public.

### Pre-requisites

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (at least v12). It should also install npm together. We recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/blob/master/README.md) to manage NodeJS installation and versions on your machine.
- [Visual Studio Code (VSCode)](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) is our recommended IDE. You can use any other IDE as a code editor of your choice but you might miss out some useful plugins for debugging.
